# Toontown Open Level Editor
 
## An (soon to be) open sourced modernized version of Disney's in-house Toontown Online level editor used to create .dna files.

## Requirements
### ***IMPORTANT***
* You need a Panda3D build with [THIS](https://github.com/drewc5131/panda3d/commit/2b735df2d0b8f9880311a9a08a28c7ec684e9583) fix (You can just edit the .py file in ur SDK) This reverts a change that completely breaks the TTLE and RTM
* Build yourself a copy of [Disyer's libtoontown](https://github.com/darktohka/libtoontown)
* Recent Panda3D build running on *__Python 3__*. This editor is NOT compatible with Python 2.x and will NOT ever be made compatible as Python 2.x is no longer supported.

### You can also pick up a pre-built build in the releases tab
