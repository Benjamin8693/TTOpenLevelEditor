# Toontown Level Editor 2020 Edition
 
## An (soon to be) open sourced modernized version of Disney's in-house Toontown Online level editor used to create .dna files.

### It currently isn't the most usable due to a panda bug that I am currently investigating. However, the entire base functionality should work if you can get around the bug.

## Requirements
* Build yourself a copy of [Disyer's libtoontown](https://github.com/darktohka/libtoontown)
* Recent Panda3D build running on *__Python 3__*. This editor is NOT compatible with Python 2.x and will NOT ever be made compatible as Python 2.x is no longer supported.
